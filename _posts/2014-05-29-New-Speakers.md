## New Speakers Confirmed

Two specialists in online journalism and crowd-funding campaigns will join the [awesome lineup](http://www.decatorevista.ro/storytelling/2014/speakers.html) we’ve already announced for this year’s edition of The Power of Storytelling, which takes place on October 17-18, at Pullman Hotel.

Rob Wijnberg and Ernst-Jan Pfauth are co-founders of [De Correspondent](https://decorrespondent.nl/en), a Dutch-language, online journalism platform that offers background, analysis, investigative reporting, and the kind of stories that tend to escape the radar of mainstream media because they do not conform to what is normally understood to be ‘news’. 

The platform was launched in September 2013 after raising more than 1 Million Euros from 15,000 donors in just eight days time, setting a [crowd-funding world record](http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/04/a-dutch-crowdfunded-news-site-has-raised-1-3-million-and-hopes-for-a-digital-native-journalism/) in journalism

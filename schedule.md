**Mona Nicoară** 

_The Boundaries of the Storyteller:_ A journalist, an activist, and an artist walk into the same story. I have no punchline, just a few strange insights that came out of the muted struggle between the three over the six years it took to make my documentary Our School. 

**Chris Jones**

_Getting The Goods:_ Good reporting is essential to telling true stories, but there is more to reporting than the simple gathering of facts. Nobody reads phone books, and they’re filled with facts. Good stories offer something more; they reveal something larger about the world. Careful reporting will help you tell that kind of story, but most important, it should also reveal why your story matters—why it should count.

**Jacqui Banaszynski**

_Pebbles In The Pond – Touching Hearts One Story At A Time:_ The success of stories is often measured in impact – how many clicks they receive, how many laws they change, how many injustices they reveal. But stories have another purpose and power – the power to reach people, to reveal our shared humanity, and to create ripples that become waves that land on unseen shores. The emotional impact of stories can’t easily be counted. But it should never been discounted.

**Jens Lekman**

_Singing Stories:_ Jens Lekman is known for the narratives embedded in his songs, be they about relationships, or one’s place in the world. Many of his songs are stories drawn from real life, and Jens will talk about the creative process of putting them together, as well as sing a few to demonstrate.

**Tom Junod**

Tom Junod's keynote description will be announced soon.

**Tom Junod and Chris Jones panel**

_Your Voice And How To Use It:_ Tom and Chris believe in the same things, but they express them with radically different voices. In this panel discussion, they’ll talk about style, inspiration, influence, and why they write the way they write. (Hint: Chris has tried to write like Tom. He can’t.)

**Jacqui Banaszynski**

_The Art Of The Interview – A Creative Dance Of Intimacy And Ethics:_ Many stories fail before a writer ever sits down at the keyboard. They suffer from the question not asked, the detail not gathered, the nuance not noticed. We’ll explore interviewing as much more than the usual Q&A, but rather as a vibrant dynamic that turns subjects into storytellers, and articles into stories. We’ll place special attention on the profound relationship that is built when interviewing people about sensitive matters – and the care that must be taken in being fair to the subjects but true to the story.

**Mona Nicoară**

_Putting The Right Things In The Right Order:_ Editing a story, whether on film, on the radio, in pictures or on paper is the hardest job of them all. We will look at this complicated trial-and-error process of finding the story, re-discovering intentions, and honoring audiences through concrete examples drawn from documentary filmmaking, and we will engage in a practical exercise trying to answer that age-old question: "How to begin?"

Humans are narrative creatures. We explain our lives, businesses, countries, values, and choices through stories. In this age of information overload, well-told, well-written, and well-produced stories are essential to keep our communities alive, and reflect our common humanity.

This conference, now in its third year, will teach us how to build better stories so we can better communicate, create emotion, and transform our audiences. The conference is aimed at those who want to tell better stories, whether they come from a journalism, communication, business, or NGO background.

## The focus of the 2013 conference will be on how we can use storytelling to create a better society.

If stories bring people closer, if they connect, if they create emotional bonds, does that mean they can help create some kind of personal and, who knows, maybe even societal change? If stories can be a force for good as a society examines itself and sets course for the future, what are the best practices and tools needed to create impact?

These are some of other questions the conference will explore through discussions of **reporting and writing creative nonfiction, and producing documentary films.** The speakers will present a range of ways and options to talk about how storytelling in various forms tackles modern issues.

Whether you are a reporter, an editor, a communicator, or just a lover of stories, we believe this conference will provide you with inspiration and joy. We will celebrate the power of stories with award winning reporters, writers, editors and producers. With their guidance, we'll also learn new tools to make our own stories better.

### What is narrative journalism?

Narrative journalism – also referred to as literary journalism, creative nonfiction or narrative nonfiction – is a genre that brings literary devices into the journalistic work, without comprising the integrity of facts. The best of nonfiction storytelling is, as writer Walt Harrington said, “news you can feel.” It is scenic, it has characters, dialogue, and it aims to create an emotional experience for the public.

Here is a guide to make your stay in Bucharest a little easier. 


### Currency

Romania's currency is RON/ lei. 1 EURO is approximately 4.4 lei. You can get lei from one of the many ATMs in the city or the airport, or you can exchange foreign currencies at banks and authorized exchange offices (they are called: „casa de schimb” or „birou de schimb valutar”).

### Getting in: Bucharest International Airport

You have two options to get from the airport to the city:

**Bus:** Bus 783 will take you into the city. You will need to purchase a bus ticket, which costs approximately 1.6 euros, and is the equivalent of two trips to / from the airport. 

**Taxi:** The taxi must be ordered from inside the terminal, from a booth. The average cost for a trip to the city center is 7-12 euros.

### Safety
Bucharest is considered a safe city in Europe, but as in most capitals in the world you are advised to take certain safety precautions. The emergency telephone number for the Police is **112** (toll free).
We recommend that you look into having health insurance that is available in Romania in case of emergency.
